# Projects
History of some of my coding projects.

Website: http://www1.udel.edu/atom/

Not shown: Undergraduate research on quasars. I no longer have access to the University of Oklahoma's systems which is where all the data and code was stored. Highlights of those projects were: 
large dataset manipulation, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, 
PCA, EMPCA, k-means clustering, autocorrelation, 
outlier detection and noise accoutability (some quasars have extremly noisy data) designing simulated quasar spectra, 
testing models, reconstructing real spectra from eigenvectors, 
passing eigenvectors to ML pipeline, visually representing results in presentation to non-astrophysicists. 
All of that work was done in Python.
